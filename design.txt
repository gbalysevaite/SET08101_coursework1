		<h2> What are ciphers? </h2>
			<p> In cryptography, a cipher (or cypher) is an algorithm for performing encryption or decryptionâ€”a series of well-defined steps that can be followed as a procedure. An alternative, less common term is encipherment. To encipher or encode is to convert information into cipher or code. In common parlance, "cipher" is synonymous with "code", as they are both a set of steps that encrypt a message; however, the concepts are distinct in cryptography, especially classical cryptography.
				Code generally substitute different length strings of characters in the output, while ciphers generally substitute the same number of characters as are input. There are exceptions and some cipher systems may use slightly more, or fewer, characters when output versus the number that were input.<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cipher">[1]</a>

		<h2> Why classical ciphers? </h2>
			<p> Crytography has been through numerous phases of evolution. Early ciphers in cryptography were designed to allow encryption and decryption to take place by hand, while those which are developed and used today 
			    are only possible due to the high computational performance of modern machines (i.e the computer you are using right now). There are modern and historical (otherwise known as classical) ciphers. In this page where are going to use the latter ones.
